Objective 1
Identify when vehicles are likely to be stolen
Your first objective is to explore the vehicle and date fields in the stolen_vehicles table to identify when vehicles tend to be stolen


Objective 2
Identify which vehicles are likely to be stolen
Your second objective is to explore the vehicle type, age, luxury vs standard and color fields in the stolen_vehicles table to identify which vehicles are most likely to be stolen


Objective 3
Identify where vehicles are likely to be stolen
Your third objective is to explore the population and density statistics in the regions table to identify where vehicles are getting stolen, and visualize the results using a scatter plot and map.





Objective 1
Identify when vehicles are likely to be stolen
Your first objective is to explore the vehicle and date fields in the stolen_vehicles table to identify when vehicles tend to be stolen
Task:
--->Find the number of vehicles stolen each year
---->Find the number of vehicles stolen each month
---->Find the number of vehicles stolen each day of the week
---->Replace the numeric day of week values with the full name of each day of the week (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
----->Create a bar chart that shows the number of vehicles stolen on each day of the week


Objective 2
Identify which vehicles are likely to be stolen
Your second objective is to explore the vehicle type, age, luxury vs standard and color fields in the stolen_vehicles table to identify which vehicles are most likely to be stolen

Task:
---->Find the vehicle types that are most often and least often stolen
---->For each vehicle type, find the average age of the cars that are stolen
---->For each vehicle type, find the percent of vehicles stolen that are luxury versus standard
---->Create a table where the rows represent the top 10 vehicle types, the columns represent the top 7 vehicle colors (plus 1 column for all other colors) and the values are the number of vehicles stolen
---->Create a heat map of the table comparing the vehicle types and colors



Objective 3
Identify where vehicles are likely to be stolen
Your third objective is to explore the population and density statistics in the regions table to identify where vehicles are getting stolen, and visualize the results using a scatter plot and map.

Task
----->Find the number of vehicles that were stolen in each region
----->Combine the previous output with the population and density statistics for each region
----->Do the types of vehicles stolen in the three most dense regions differ from the three least dense regions?
----->Create a scatter plot of population versus density, and change the size of the points based on the number of vehicles stolen in each region
----->Create a map of the regions and color the regions based on the number of stolen vehicles


----->How many total vehicles were stolen in the most dense region?
