Data cleaning in Excel involves organizing and correcting data to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and usable. This process includes removing duplicates, 
handling missing values, standardizing formats for text, numbers, and dates, and correcting inconsistent or invalid entries. Functions like TRIM, CLEAN, and SUBSTITUTE can help fix common issues, 
while tools like Remove Duplicates, Find & Replace, and Data Validation ensure data consistency. For advanced tasks, splitting or merging columns and using Power Query can simplify the process. 
Clean data is essential for accurate analysis and decision-making.
